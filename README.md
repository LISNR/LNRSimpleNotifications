##How do I set it up?

We're glad you asked.

If your project is in Swift:

1. Install the Pod. Remember to add __use_frameworks!__ to your Podfile.
2. Add the AudioToolbox framework to your project. 
3. Add __import LNRSimpleNotifications__ in the classes you want to trigger or style your in-app notifications.
4. (Optional) Style your notifications in your AppDelegate's __application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:__ method or your notification manager's initializer.
5. There is no step Five.

If your project is in Objective-C:

1. Install the Pod. Remember to add __use_frameworks!__ to your Podfile.
2. Add the AudioToolbox framework to your project.
3. Set "Defines Modules" to __Yes__ in your build settings.
4. Import the LNRSimpleNotification module's Xcode-generated Swift header file in the classes you want to trigger and style your in-app notifications. The name of this header should be __#import \<LNRSimpleNotifications/LNRSimpleNotifications-Swift.h>__.
5. (Optional) Style your notifications in your AppDelegate's __application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:__ method or your notification manager's initializer.

## Demo Project

To run the demo project clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

##How do I use it?
Configure up your notification styles once in your app. We usually use the method __application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:__ in __AppDelegate.m__. The init method for whatever class is triggering your in-app notifications is also a good choice.

__AppDelegate.m__

```swift
import LNRSimpleNotifications

###

func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
	// Override point for customization after application launch.
        
	LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.notificationsPosition = LNRNotificationPosition.Top
	LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.notificationsBackgroundColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
	LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.notificationsTitleTextColor = UIColor.blackColor()
	LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.notificationsBodyTextColor = UIColor.darkGrayColor()
	LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.notificationsSeperatorColor = UIColor.grayColor()
        
	var alertSoundURL: NSURL? = NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource("click", withExtension: "wav")
	if let _ = alertSoundURL {
		var mySound: SystemSoundID = 0
		AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID(alertSoundURL!, &mySound)
		LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.notificationSound = mySound
	}
        
	return true
}
```

You can also configure an icon that will appear in your notification and set a custom font for the notification title and body.

If you don't set any theme options your notifications will default to black text on a white background with no notification sound or icon.


__The Class Triggering Notifications__

```swift
import LNRSimpleNotifications

###

func methodThatTriggersNotification:(title: String, body: String) {
	LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.showNotification("Test Title", body: "Test Body", callback: { () -> Void in
		LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.dismissActiveNotification({ () -> Void in
			println("Notification dismissed")
		})
	})
}
```

__Three Default Notification Types__

* Succeed Notification

```swift
LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.showSucceedNotification("Action Succeed", body: "Congratulations!") { () -> Void in
            
            LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.dismissActiveNotification({ () -> Void in
                print("Notification disimissed")
            })
        }
```

* Failed Notification

```swift
LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.showFailedNotification("Action Failed", body: "WTF?!") { () -> Void in
            
            LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.dismissActiveNotification({ () -> Void in
                print("Notification disimissed")
            })
        }
```

![succeed](http://7qnc72.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/notificationfailed.png)

* Info Notification

```swift
LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.showInfoNotification("Info", body: "Just leave you a message!") { () -> Void in
            
            LNRSimpleNotifications.sharedNotificationManager.dismissActiveNotification({ () -> Void in
                print("Notification disimissed")
            })
        }
```

##Known Bugs

###Since 0.1.0

1. If you trigger notifications very rapidly they'll start appearing immediately instead of waiting for the one before to be dismissed before displaying. If this happens notifications will start appearing over notifications that were already on screen.

##Pull Requests?
Absolutely!
